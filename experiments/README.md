# Experiments
Different experiment campaigns should be stored here.
The idea is to build upon the provided scripts in `../scripts` to build
a experiment-specific run and build script.
It's also possible to re-implement everything from scratch, as
the communication to the injection controller is relatively simple.

See `rh` for reference to implement your own experiment.
